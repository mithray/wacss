## Design Systems
- [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/). The strictest accessibility component designer I know of.(Best)
- [Odyssey](https://odyssey.okta.design/). Native HTML/CSS. (Good).
- [Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/). Nice looking and usually simple and practical. Vanilla version is quite good.
- [Paragon](https://openedx.github.io/paragon/components/). React dependent(Not accessible). 
- [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components). React dependent(Not accessible).
- [Clarity](https://clarity.design/). Framework Dependent(Not accesible)

- [Design Tokens](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/design-tokens/) "Now, the difference between design tokens and any other design variable is that they are an abstraction layer that makes them platform-agnostic. The naming conventions in this layer creates a common language for design properties that can be deployed across all your platforms and implementation frameworks."
"A major component of a design tokens practice is the hierarchy or family tree of design decisions. For ease of use, itâ€™s recommended to use Category/Type/Item (CTI) naming conventions to define tokens in a hierarchical tree structure of options and decisions. CTI does not limit the number of hierarchical levels, which allows for flexibility within your naming practice and allows you room to scale. Using this method, there are two types of design tokens: Global tokens, which control all instances of a particular design decision, and alias tokens, which control specific uses of tokens."
I want to create Universal design tokens and to name them accordingly. Global Tokens could be considered these UDT which can potentially be organization independent. Alias Tokens, on the other hand, are where tokens could be changed quickly and easily.
