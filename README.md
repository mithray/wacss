## Introduction

WaCSS is a design system compiled to a CSS stylesheet designed to work on bare (Classless) Semantic HTML5, which enhances accessibility, and uses standards based components. 

## Contents

1. Design Tokens - Global
2. Design Tokens - Common
3. Design Tokens - Components
4. Components

## Goal

I am making this library mostly for light developers more orientated towards business, publishers, bloggers, and possibly user agents as a base styler. I hope a light developer will be able to write almost exclusively HTML documents, import the CSS and JS from this library, modify a few design tokens, and get a website that looks pretty much just like every other website. I am writing for people who use *only* HTML, but this HTML must be high quality for the library to work. The documentation will largely focus on showing the developer which Semantic HTML5, Schema, Attributes and Aria Roles will be needed to trigger the CSS to perceive a component.
