## Introduction

WaCSS is a design system compiled to a CSS stylesheet designed to work on bare (Classless) Semantic HTML5, which enhances accessibility, and uses standards based components. 

## Contents

1. Design Tokens - Global
2. Design Tokens - Common
3. Design Tokens - Components
4. Components

## Goal

I am making this library mostly for light developers(more orientated towards business), publishers, bloggers, possibly user agents as a base styler, and perhaps designers(if I can add enough configurational ability to the design tokens). I hope that people within these groups can write exclusively HTML documents, import the CSS and JS from this library, modify a few design tokens, and get a website that looks high quality and modern with great accessibility. Though using *only* HTML will be possible(accepting the default design tokens), this HTML must be high standardized and semantic quality for the library to work. The documentation will largely focus on showing the developer which Semantic HTML5, Schema, Attributes and Aria Roles will be needed to trigger the CSS to perceive a component.
